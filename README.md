# LoRA-based Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

## Project Summary
This project fine-tunes a **DistilBERT** model for sentiment analysis using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, an efficient technique for model fine-tuning. The goal is to classify sentences into sentiment categories (positive/negative) with enhanced efficiency.

## Tools and Techniques
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
- **DistilBERT** (Pre-trained Model)
- **Transformers Library** (Hugging Face)
- **PyTorch** (Model Training and Inference)

## Datasets Used
- **IMDB Dataset**: A collection of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
